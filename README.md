## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AngelikaMarciniak

As a creative, always positive person with a lot of ambitions I am working very hard do develop my goals.
Since many years I work for gastronomic business and study computer science at the same time: I graduated 4 years IT Hight School with 95% of proffesion diploma 
and  I received every year the scholarship for high academic results. At work I always received responsabilities and promotions to be a leader because of my attitude
and great contacts with team. Now I study Computer Science in the University in Poland, still with great grades and still to be a leader in the restaurant in Norway.
I am planning my future to combain my skills from gastronomic industry and IT what will be very helpfull to became a Team Leader or Project Menager in uppcomming years.
